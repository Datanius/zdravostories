# Prompt

```
Please write a short, coherent story in German (A1/A2 level) in Markdown for a language learning book. The story should describe a morning at the coffee shop and include plenty of dialogue to help learners practice everyday conversations.

1) Images / Placeholders:
    The Markdown should include image placeholders that reference text-to-image prompts.
    Each placeholder should be a unique hash-like string (to avoid duplicates).
    For example: ![HASH](HASH)
2) JSON at the top:
    At the very beginning of the Markdown file, provide a JSON object mapping each hash placeholder to its descriptive text-to-image prompt.
    The format should be {HASH: "PROMPT", ...}.
    Do not prefix this JSON with backticks + json or any other code fence.
3) Include English translations:
    Alongside each sentence or paragraph, include an English translation for language learners.
4) Vocabulary section:
	At the end of the Markdown, provide a list of important words, including their translation and pronunciation (where relevant).
5) Wrap in a code block:
	The entire Markdown content (including the JSON and the story) should be placed inside a code block so that it is not directly rendered by the web
